## Tool Usage Guidance

- **Claude Code** and **Cursor**: Use both for best results.
  - *Opus 4.1*: Only use for complex tasks (it is very limited).

- **GPT-5.1 High**: Use for planning, brainstorming, and step finding.
- **Sonnet**: Use for execution tasks.

- **Cursor (Plan mode)**: Use for very complex tasks.
- **Claude**: Use for massive tasks like architecture.


## Plan mode

Every action that i take with cursor and AI it goes through `Plan mode`, in cursor you can pick that from the options.
It will list the whole plan in text format that the AI will do, you can review and change some stuff in it and after reviewing then you click `build`. 

1. Cursor Plan Mode is currently better than Claude Code
  - That's why we use Cursor Plan Mode for insanely complex problems.

## Claude Code

### Keywords
  - `ultrathink` -> Makes the Claude Code to think extra harder (maybe consumes more tokens)

### Background tasks
  - i can run background tasks like (run the server in background for me) and now it has access to the server logs.

### MCP servers
  - Just let me access the latest versions of some dependency versions and so on.

Some useful ones:
  - Supabase MCP

### Bug Bot
  - review, find bugs, security issues

### Use Claude for Deep Research for technical issues
  - "Whats the best way to store data", "What to use to achieve this and that", ...
