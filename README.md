# ai-lab

Personal notes focused on periodic research and experimentation with LLMs, specifically analyzing which models perform best for different coding tasks (e.g. reasoning, debugging, refactoring, smart contracts, Rust/Solidity, etc.).

The goal is to stay up to date on:

Strengths and weaknesses of each LLM

Best model-to-task mapping for development workflows

Practical usage patterns rather than theory
